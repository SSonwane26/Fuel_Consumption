# Fuel_Consumption
Exploring the data of fuel consumption from year 2000 to year 2023. Using MS Excel to perform various statistical and graphical techniques to answer some relevant questions and gain insights.

Datasets provide model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.
Data from DATASET(https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64)
Fuel consumption is a measure of how much fuel a vehicle uses to travel a given distance. It is an important indicator of vehicle performance, environmental impact, and cost efficiency. 
In this analysis, I will explore the data of fuel consumption from year 2000 to year 2023, which contains information on year, model, engine size, engine size, fuel type, fuel consumption and CO2 emission. 
I will use Excel to perform various statistical and graphical techniques to answer some relevant questions and gain insights into the trends and patterns of fuel consumption for different models and factors.
My goal is to understand how fuel consumption has changed over time and what factors affect it. I hope this analysis will help me improve my data analysis skills and learn more about fuel consumption.
